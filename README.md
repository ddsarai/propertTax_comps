A work in progress looking at some data related to property taxes in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) as well as Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver

### Abstract
This repository contains a few notebooks I create to explore some property tax data.  Intitally, I was putting together some property tax comparisons for 2021 of the various municipalities that are included in the Greater Toronto Area. The data is drawn from the annual Financial Information Returns (FIR) that the Ontario government requires of all municipalities.  After a bit of data wrangling, I put together a series of charts comparing the tax rates of select property classes.  

I then expanded to look at property tax rates for 2021 in some other major metropolitan areas in Canada - Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver.  I tried to put together a series of charts similar to that I had created for the GTA.  The differences in the structure of property classes between the three provinces howerver means that the comparison are inexact.  For example, in contrast to Ontario's multitude of property classes and subclasses, Alberta property tax is broken down into really only three classes - residential, residential-farm, and non-residential.  British Columbia has a greater number of classes than Alberta, but still relatively few in comparison to Ontario.  In spite of these difference, a degree of broad comparison is still possible and allows for some interesting insights.

Next, I concatenated a number of FIR spreadsheets from various years to look at how property tax rates and ratios have changed in the GTA over the period from 2011 to 2021.
